        <h1 class="display-4">Glider Flight Planner User Guide</h1>

        <p>Welcome to the Glider Flight Planner User Guide! This guide will walk you through the features of the application and explain how to use it effectively to plan your glider flights.</p>
    
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Accessing the Application</strong>: Navigate to the Glider Flight Planner application in your web browser. You'll be greeted with a clean interface that includes a data table and a form for flight parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding the Data Table</strong>: The table displays various center locations with details like Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Type, Name, Description, and Category. This data is essential for plotting your flight path.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Using the Application</h2>
    
        <h3>Selecting and Entering Center Locations</h3>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Browse through the data table to view available center locations.</li>
            <li>Use the search bar above the table to quickly find specific locations by name or other attributes.</li>
            <li>Click on the checkboxes next to each location to select them. You can select multiple locations within the visible rows.</li>
            <li>Use the "Select Visible Rows" button to select all locations currently displayed on the page.</li>
            <li>To manually enter a location, scroll to the dynamic form field section and input the location's name, altitude, latitude, and longitude.</li>
            <li>You can add multiple manual locations by clicking the plus sign (+) to add additional rows to the form.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>Inputting Flight Parameters</h3>
    
        <p>Below the data table, you'll find a form where you can input various flight parameters:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wind Direction</strong>: Enter the wind direction in degrees (between 0 and 360).</li>
            <li><strong>Wind Speed</strong>: Input the wind speed in knots or your preferred unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Glide Ratio</strong>: Provide the glide ratio of your glider.</li>
            <li><strong>Vg (Best Glide Speed)</strong>: Enter the best glide speed for your glider.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Margin</strong>: Input a safety margin as a percentage (between 0% and 100%). This margin accounts for uncertainties and ensures you have a buffer in your calculations.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Viewing the Flight Path</h3>
    
        <ol>
            <li>After selecting and/or manually entering center locations and inputting flight parameters, click the "Create Map" button.</li>
            <li>The application will process your input and display a folium map showcasing minimum altitude contour rings based on the selected and manually entered center locations and provided parameters.</li>
            <li>You can overlay the contour rings on top of satellite imagery, topographic maps, and FAA sectional charts. Use the layer selector on the top right of the map.</li>
            <li>Hover over or click on the landing locations to view more details.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Interpreting the Results</h2>
    
        <p>The folium map displays minimum altitude contour rings around each landing location. Here's how to interpret the results:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Landing Locations</strong>: The selected and manually entered landing locations are marked on the map. You can hover over or click on these markers to view more details.</li>
            <li><strong>Flight Contour Rings</strong>: The contour rings represent the minimum altitude required at that location for a safe glide back to the landing location. These rings are calculated based on the flight parameters you provided.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Margins</strong>: The safety margin you inputted is factored into the flight path calculations. It ensures that the displayed path has a buffer, accounting for uncertainties.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Tips and Best Practices</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Always double-check your input values to ensure accuracy.</li>
            <li>Consider both manually entered locations and selected locations from the table to optimize your flight planning.</li>
            <li>Use the safety margin wisely. A higher safety margin provides a larger buffer but might also limit your flight options.</li>
            <li>Regularly refer to this user guide and the application's documentation for any updates or new features.</li>
        </ul>
